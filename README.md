## Project Abstract
In this project, we evaluate the platform-wise effect on boosting production of a social nudge sent from the follower to the creator. Given a self-generated following relationship network on the platform, we have conducted a precise calculation of the global effect. Also an approximation is developed to avoid massive calculation in practical application. 

## Project Significance
As data science students immersed in the very environment with developed technology and fragmented entertainment, We can keenly feel the impact of social media on people's lives, as exemplified by short video platforms. Also as users of social media platforms, we have noticed that sending social nudge could significantly simulate the creator's productivity. 

In this project, we quantify the global effect of sending one social nudge. This gives out a specific view of how users' activity could create values to the overall platform. 

## Working Content
* Generated a simulated social platform network based on following relationship with manully set parameters (e.g. nodes number, probability of following, etc.);
* Calculated the true value of social nudge effect;
* Generated an approximate global effect of social nudge, proved that the approximation converges to the true value;
* Generated a downsample approximation to further reduce the calculation complexity.
